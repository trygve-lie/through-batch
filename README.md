# through-batch

[![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/trygve-lie/through-batch.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/trygve-lie/through-batch)[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/trygve-lie/through-batch/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/trygve-lie/through-batch) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/trygve-lie/through-batch.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)


Transform stream that buffer up object in the stream and pushes the buffers as 
batches further down the stream.



## Installation

```bash
$ npm install through-batch
```



## Example

Buffer up 4 objects in an object stream.

```js

const JSONStream = require('JSONStream')
      batch = require('through-batch'),
      fs = require('fs');


fs.createReadStream('objects.json')
  .pipe(JSONStream.parse('*'))
  .pipe(batch(4))
  .pipe(JSONStream.stringify())
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('batchedObjects.json'));
```



## Description

This module will buffer up objects in an object stream and batch of events with
the buffered up objects further down the stream.

The output of the stream will then emit arrays containing the buffered up
objects.



## API

This module have the following API:

### throughBatch(size, transform)

Creates an instance for batching.

```js
const const throughBatch = require('through-batch');
let batch = throughBatch(size, transform);
```


### size (required)

How many objects each batch should contain.


### transform

A transform function used to transform the objects that is being buffered.

```js
let batch = throughBatch(4, (obj) => {
    obj['_foo'] = 'bar';
    return obj;
});
```



## node.js compabillity

This module use some native ES6 functions only found in node.js 4.x and newer. 
This module will not function with older than 4.x versions of node.js.



## error handling

This module does not handle errors for you, so you must handle errors on 
whatever streams you pipe into this module. This is a general rule when 
programming with node.js streams: always handle errors on each and every stream. 

We recommend using [`end-of-stream`](https://npmjs.org/end-of-stream) or [`pump`](https://npmjs.org/pump) 
for writing error tolerant stream code.
